    <p>We’ll begin very easily here, because I’m assuming you 
        are just starting out. No one likes to look back on my
         first site, but hopefully your experience can be made 
         slightly less traumatic with a push in the right direction.
          You did Start Here first, right? It’s not a necessity, 
          but it helps.</p>
